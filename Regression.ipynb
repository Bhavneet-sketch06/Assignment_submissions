    "Heteroscedasticity can also indicate that the model is misspecified. For instance, it may suggest that some important predictors are missing from the model or that a non-linear relationship exists between the predictors and the dependent variable. Addressing heteroscedasticity can therefore lead to better model specification and performance."

    "Q22. Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
    "Ans.Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression is important for several reasons, particularly when working with variables that have vastly different scales. Below are the key reasons why scaling is beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Avoiding Dominance of Large-Scale Variables\n",
    "Variables with larger magnitudes can dominate those with smaller magnitudes in computations, especially in techniques that involve distance or magnitude (e.g., gradient descent optimization in some implementations of regression).\n",
    "Scaling ensures all variables are treated equally in the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improving Numerical Stability\n",
    "In regression, scaling can prevent issues with numerical stability during matrix operations (e.g., calculating the inverse of the covariance matrix).\n",
    "Variables with widely different ranges can lead to rounding errors or inaccurate calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simplifying Interpretation of Coefficients\n",
    "Scaling makes the interpretation of coefficients more intuitive when predictors have different units or magnitudes.\n",
    "After scaling:\n",
    "The regression coefficients represent the effect of a 1 standard deviation change in the predictor on the dependent variable.\n",
