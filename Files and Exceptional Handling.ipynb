    "Multithreading is generally better suited for tasks that involve I/O-bound operations or require shared memory access.\n",
    "1.I/O Bound Applications : Threads are lightweight and can share memory space, making it easy to handle multiple I/O-bound tasks without significant overhead.\n",
    "2.Real Time or Low Latency  Applications : Threads allow quick context switching and avoid the overhead of process creation, making them ideal for applications where responsiveness is critical.\n",

    "Snenarios where Multiprocessing is preferable :\n",

    "1.CPU-Bound Applications : Processes run on separate cores and avoid the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in languages like Python, allowing true parallelism.\n",
    "2.Tasks Needing Fault Isolation : Processes have independent memory spaces, so a crash in one process won't affect others.\n",

    "Q2, Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
    "Ans.A process pool is a collection of pre-created worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently. It provides a convenient mechanism for managing and reusing a fixed number of processes, avoiding the overhead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly for each task.\n",
    "Working of Process Pool :\n",
    "The pool creates a fixed number of processes (workers) at the start.Then the tasks are submitted to the pool, and the pool assigns them to available worker processes.Accordingly each worker executes its assigned task. Once a worker finishes a task, it becomes available for new tasks.When all tasks are completed, the pool can be closed or terminated.\n",
    "Benefits of using a process pool :\n",
    "1.Limits the number of processes to a predefined value, preventing resource overuse and contention.\n",
    "2.Reusing existing processes saves the overhead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly.\n",
    "3.Pools scale efficiently with the number of CPU cores, allowing better utilization of multi-core systems."

    "Q3.Explain what multiprocessing is and why it is used in Python programs.\n",
    "Ans.Multiprocessing is a programming technique that enables a program to run multiple processes simultaneously. Each process runs independently, with its own memory space, allowing parallel execution of tasks. This approach leverages multi-core processors to achieve true parallelism, enhancing performance for CPU-intensive tasks.In Python, the multiprocessing module provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which limits the execution of threads in a single process to one at a time, even on multi-core systems. This constraint makes multithreading inefficient for CPU-bound tasks in Python.\n",
    "Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL by creating separate processes, each with its own interpreter and memory space. This allows multiple tasks to run on different CPU cores in parallel, making it ideal for CPU-bound applications."
